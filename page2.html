                   Did you know that North Korea is just like a big prison? yes it is a big prison if you are born in North Korea then you can't escape you have to live there. Even if you are a tourist you have to still follow strict rules you can't bring home any videos of North Korea.Everyone in North Korea iss forced to praise Kim Jung-un and Kim Jung-un always wins in elections because if you don't vote for him He will get the military to find you and kil you so this is why i don't reccomend you go to North Korea.
